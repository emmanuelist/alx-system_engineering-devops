#### Background Context

In this project, you will debug a WordPress website running on a LAMP stack to fix a 500 Internal Server Error. You will use `strace` to identify the source of the error and then apply a fix using Puppet.

#### Requirements

- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The project root directory must contain a `README.md` file.
- Puppet manifests must pass `puppet-lint` version 2.1.1 without errors.
- Puppet manifests must run without error and end with the extension `.pp`.
- Files will be checked with Puppet v3.4.

#### Tasks

- **Task 0: Strace is your friend**
    - Use `strace` to identify the source of the 500 Internal Server Error.
    - Automate the fix using Puppet.
    - Store the Puppet code in a file named `0-strace_is_your_friend.pp`.

#### Installation

    cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x17-web_stack_debugging_3
    ```

#### Usage

To apply the Puppet code:

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```shell
    cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x17-web_stack_debugging_3
    ```

2. **Run the Puppet code**:
    ```shell
    sudo puppet apply 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
    ```

3. **Check the web server**:
    ```shell
    curl -sI 127.0.0.1
    ```

#### Testing

You can test your code using the following commands:

- **Check Puppet manifest**:
    ```shell
    puppet-lint 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
    ```

- **Apply Puppet code**:
    ```shell
    sudo puppet apply 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
    ```

- **Verify the server**:
    ```shell
    curl -sI 127.0.0.1
    ```

#### Troubleshooting
