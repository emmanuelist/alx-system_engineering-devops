# 0x19. Postmortem

## Project Overview

The 0x19-postmortem project focuses on the creation of a postmortem report for an incident or outage. The postmortem is a crucial tool for understanding the causes of failures in a software system and for taking corrective measures to prevent future occurrences. The aim is to provide a concise yet comprehensive report that details the incident, its impact, timeline, root cause, resolution, and corrective actions.

## Requirements

1. **Issue Summary**
    - Duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone).
    - Impact of the outage (e.g. services affected, user experience, percentage of users impacted).
    - Root cause of the outage.

2. **Timeline**
    - Time the issue was detected.
    - How the issue was detected (e.g. monitoring alert, customer complaint).
    - Actions taken (e.g. parts of the system investigated, assumptions on the root cause).
    - Misleading investigation paths.
    - Individuals or teams the incident was escalated to.
    - How the incident was resolved.

3. **Root Cause and Resolution**
    - Detailed explanation of the root cause of the issue.
    - Explanation of how the issue was resolved.

4. **Corrective and Preventative Measures**
    - Improvements or fixes that can be made to prevent future incidents.
    - List of specific tasks to address the issue (e.g. patching servers, adding monitoring).

## Additional Information

- The postmortem should be between 400-600 words and written in English.
- Add humor or visuals to make the postmortem engaging.
- Make sure to request a manual QA review of your postmortem before the project's deadline.
